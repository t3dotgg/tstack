# sol-loop

This is a workflow for making your code changes more correct before (or
sometimes after) filing a pull request. tl;dr - use OpenAI's GPT Sol to review
your code in a loop.

Make the most minimal possible changes to appease the Sol reviewers. Be careful
of scope creep and don't be scared to push back.

## Budget

- Default: 3 rounds total. Round 1 is full. Later rounds check only
  changed code and open findings.
- Extend to 5 only for security, permissions, auth, data loss, or
  state/concurrency, while a blocker or should stays open with evidence. Or when
  the user asks.
- Stop early if a round returns only nits. Declined nits and comment,
  doc, or format-only fixes need no new round.
- One reviewer only. Sol must not start subagents or reviewers.
- Keep a ledger: id, severity, outcome, usage if returned. Never guess it.

## 1. Scope

Run `git status --short`. Do not stash, discard, or include unrelated
changes. Limit review to the change paths if they separate cleanly.
Otherwise stop and ask.

Find the base after `git fetch origin`:

- PR: `gh pr view <n> --json baseRefName,headRefOid`. Check out the branch
  only if clean. Confirm `HEAD` is the PR head, or ahead only by this
  change. Base: `git merge-base HEAD origin/<baseRefName>`.
- Local: `git merge-base HEAD origin/<default-branch>`. No remote: a base
  the user names, or `HEAD` for uncommitted changes only.

The change is base to working tree in those paths, with untracked files.
Use one diff command all rounds. State intent and out-of-scope in 1-2
sentences. Run covering checks. Do not send code this change breaks. Note
missing or pre-failing checks in the brief.

## 2. Start Sol

In T3, call `orchestrator_capabilities`. Pick the latest Sol unless the user
named a version. Do not hardcode an ID. Record provider, model, and effort
only if exposed. Use `delegate_task` every round (`role: "review"`,
`mode: "wait"`, `timeoutMs: 600000`). Save `taskId` and `childThreadId`.
New `clientRequestId` per round. The review brief must tell Sol: "Read only
the diff and the files it touches. Reply as soon as you have a verdict, then
stop."
`childThreadId` is storage, not the next target. Do not use
`t3_thread_send`, `create_threads`, or `t3_thread_launch` for review.

If T3 tools are not listed, try one direct capability call. Outside T3, use
a native Sol subagent and keep its ID. In Claude Code, use a custom subagent
only if it is set up to run Sol. Apply the same bounded wait and stop rules
using that route's supported controls. If no route can enforce them, report
the blocker. Do not substitute a model.

If a wait times out, read that child thread once. If a `VERDICT:` is already
present, cancel the still-running task, verify it stopped, and use that
verdict; do not wait for the child turn to finish. If there is no verdict,
wait another 10 minutes and inspect again. Cap one review round at 30 minutes.
At the cap, cancel the child and verify it stopped; if the review budget
allows, start one fresh round with the same diff and the ledger. Otherwise
report that no verdict was returned. A timeout, error, or silence is never
approval. Do not edit scoped files while a reviewer is running or start a
second reviewer before the first is confirmed stopped.

Round 1 brief (T3 children get no history):

```
Review only. Do not edit, commit, push, comment on PRs, or start subagents.
Read only the diff and the files it touches. Reply as soon as you have a
verdict, then stop.
Repo: <abs path> Base: <sha> Intent: <intent> Out of scope: <scope> Checks: <results>
See: git diff <base> [-- <paths>]; git status --short (read untracked).
Read surrounding code. Find bugs, broken callers, mismatch with intent.
Skip style unless it hides a bug. Hold to the smallest change. Flag code,
tests, or guards the intent does not need. Other paths, rare cases, small
perf, extra compat: nits.
blocker = intended case wrong. should = real bug callers will hit, in intent. nit = rest.
Reply:
VERDICT: APPROVE or CHANGES
S1 [blocker|should|nit] <file>:<line> <claim>. Fix: <suggestion> (stable ids)
```

## 3. Answer findings

Check each finding and severity yourself. Another path, rare case, or
small cost is a nit, whatever label it came with.

- Agree: smallest fix. Prefer delete or narrow over new lock, cache,
  helper, or option. Fix the case that happened. Add one focused test
  that fails without the fix, if intent needs it.
- Disagree: say why, with evidence (file:line, test, output).
- Out of scope or nit: decline in one line. List as follow-up.

Update the ledger. Re-run checks and `git diff --shortstat <base>`. If
review grew the diff, cut first. Do not agree just to end the loop.

## 4. Next round

Start one only if budget remains and a blocker or should is open, behavior code
changed, or approval does not cover the current behavior diff. Use a fresh
`delegate_task` in T3, or follow up the saved native ID. Send the round 1 brief,
the ledger (`fixed:` / `disagree:` / `declined:` + evidence), the same base
diff, and the change since last round. Tell Sol: open ids and changed code only.
Mark each old id `resolved` or `still open: <reason>`.

## 5. Stop and ship

Agreed: APPROVE on the current behavior diff, no blocker or should open,
no concern of your own. Stuck: an item stays disputed after two replies,
or budget ends. Show both sides in 2-3 lines each. The user decides.
Budget end is not approval.

Do not push during the loop. Push after agreement only if the user asked
to push, ship, or update the PR. If you push to a PR, add above the model
blurb:

`Reviewed with sol-loop: <N> rounds with <model>. Sol verdict: approved`.

Add `on <effort>` only if verified.

Report: rounds, model, what Sol changed, diff size before/after, fixed and
declined findings with reasons, usage if exposed (else say not), pushed or not.
